# EDDIP™ (Ethernet Device Driver Interface for Portability)

EDDIP™ is an open-source, vendor-provided library written in C and Rust that enables developers to create portable, modular Ethernet drivers. By abstracting hardware specifics into a unified API, EDDIP™ allows drivers to support a wide range of Ethernet devices while maintaining performance, stability, and maintainability across Linux kernel versions.
